#  Classification of urban areas

Analysing a real-world data set which I have used in my own research. 
The data set contains information on a variety of aspects of a city, such as the 
types of building, the types of points of interest (restaurants, cafes, museums, 
attractions, ...), and other interesting features which can be found in different 
areas of most cities. An interesting topic in the study of cities is what encourages 
different people to live in different parts of a city.

This creates a decision tree that uses features of urban environments can be used 
to predict which age group is the most present in each area.
